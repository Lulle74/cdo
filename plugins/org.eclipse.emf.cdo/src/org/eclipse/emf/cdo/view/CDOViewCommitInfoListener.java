/**
 * A {@link IListener listener} that, when added to a {@link CDOView view}, {@link #notifyCommitInfo(CDOCommitInfo) notifies}
 * about {@link CDOCommitInfo commits} to the view's {@link CDOView#getBranch() branch}.
 * <p>
 * This is an alternative approach to listening for {@link CDOViewInvalidationEvent view invalidation events},
 * which impose a few usage challenges:
 * <ol>
 * <li> They're fired while the view is holding the view lock, which can lead to deadlock in a listener.
 * <li> They report only changes about objects that are actually loaded in the view, not all objects in the original commit.
 * </ol>
